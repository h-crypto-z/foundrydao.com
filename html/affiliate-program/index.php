        <h1 id="foundry-needs-marketers">Foundry needs marketers!</h1>
        <p>Selling valuable things to people who need that value is a noble art! Never let anyone tell you differently.</p>
        <p>Foundry deeply respects the art of selling. It is said that in life, we do not get what we deserve, only what we negotiate for. That is why Foundry needs people with the skill to negotiate on its behalf. When Foundry is fully built out, it will constantly have to sell itself, its products and be sold to by entrepreneurs. That is why, baked into its sale’s design is a mechanism for attracting and retaining skilled marketers as FRY holders.</p>
        <h2 id="what-foundry-is-looking-for">What Foundry is looking for</h2>
        <p>Foundry is a DAO that’s being built piecewise. One serious deficit the founding team of Foundry has identified in Crypto projects is that many of the truly useful projects have abysmal marketing. The popular slogan, “if you build it, they will come” rings hollow when you have poured months or years of your life into a product you know is great, but that no-one uses because no-one knows about it. Therefore Foundry pulls in marketers (maybe you dear reader) by giving them a referral bonus in the form of FRY. This is so that their skills can later also be applied to market the many useful projects Foundry will purchase from developers.</p>
        <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
        <p>The Foundry sale (sale.foundrydao.com) features a built-in referral program. It requires no registration or special setup; you just click the referral link and copy your referral code, which you then share with your network to earn FRY.</p>
        <p>When someone you referred purchases FRY, you are automatically credited with between 10%-20% of their purchase amount. All referral codes begin at 10% and then grow by 1/1000th of a percent with each DAI referred, up to a maximum of 20%.</p>
        <p>So, by example, if you have raised 4,500 DAI for the sale with your referral code, you will be earning 14.5% of any sales from that point on. Once you’ve reached 10,000 DAI raised you will have reached the maximum reward percentage and will be earning 20% on the purchases of anyone using your referral code to buy into the sale.</p>
        <p>You are also welcome to purchase FRY with your own referral code.</p>
