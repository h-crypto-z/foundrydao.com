<h1 id="outdated">OUTDATED</h1>
<p>Note that the below text is outdated. We have scaled back expenditures, and will release an updated, more flexible &quot;pre-gov-spending&quot; strategy soon.</p>
<p>As of Jul 31 2020, we have raised ~$12k and spent ~$2.7k on one month of costs, and we expect our expenditure rate to remain at a similar magnitude for some time.</p>
<h1 id="pre-governance-treasury-spending">Pre-Governance Treasury Spending</h1>
<p>After the Foundry Bucket Sale begins selling FRY, but before Foundry Governance is fully developed and autonomous, Team Toast will directly withdraw funds from Foundry Treasury via the Team Toast Secure Multisig (aka &quot;governance v0&quot;).</p>
<p>These funds will be used exclusively for two purposes: developing Foundry Governance to v1 (capable of autonomously making decisions without guidance from Team Toast), and marketing/developing Foundry products to provide the Foundry treasury with profit streams.</p>
<p>The numbers below are estimates. If crucial additional expenditures seem prudent, we will gauge FRY holder sentiment on the additional expenditure (if it's not too time-critical) and possibly take out more than predicted here.</p>
<p>All expenditures, planned or unplanned, will be public upon each withdrawal.</p>
<h2 id="tier-1---290k">Tier 1 - $290k</h2>
<ul>
<li>$150k: Logan - Full Time Salary</li>
<li>$75k: Schalk - Half Time Salary</li>
<li>$50k: Marketing Budget</li>
<li>$15k: Audit Budget for Governance</li>
</ul>
<p>Logan iterates SmokeSignal and Foundry Governance front-ends, while Schalk implements Foundry Governance contracts. The Marketing Budget will be used for the Foundry sale and SmokeSignal.</p>
<h2 id="tier-2---540k">Tier 2 - $540k</h2>
<ul>
<li>$290k: Tier 1 items</li>
<li>$100k: Full-time Front-end Developer</li>
<li>$50k: Administrative Worker</li>
<li>$100k: Additional Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer takes over most front-end development for Foundry products and Foundry Governance, and the Administrative Worker takes over admin tasks to free Logan up for higher-level tasks. The Marketing Budget will be used for the Foundry sale and SmokeSignal.</p>
<h2 id="tier-3---1140k">Tier 3 - $1140k</h2>
<ul>
<li>$540k: Tier 2 items</li>
<li>$300k: Small dev team for DAIHard</li>
<li>$300k: Additional Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>We market DAIHard, iterate it in response to user feedback, and find a niche market it can make profit in. If DAIHard proves to be fundamentally untenable, these resources will be diverted to SmokeSignal or some other product the Foundry community supports.</p>
<h2 id="k">&gt; $1140k</h2>
<p>If, after 1 year, Foundry Governance is not yet capable of autonomously making intelligent decisions, Team Toast may opt to bill the Treasury for an additional year of runway, with similar costs as described in this document.</p>
<p>Any raised funds funds unused by the above tasks will be held in the Treasury until Governance is ready to control it, which ultimately puts the expenditure of the funds into the hands of Foundry (and therefore FRY holders). At this point Team Toast will hold no special role in these decisions other than as FRY holders.</p>
