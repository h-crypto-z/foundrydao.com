    <p>Liquid democracy refers to a voting system allowing the delegation of one’s vote to another person, who can then in turn delegate their vote to people who ultimately make decisions. </p>
    <p>One of the challenges in constructing a DAO is that DAOs are not supposed to have a “management” class. IE, DAOs have no C-suite positions. There is no CEO, CFO, CTO, CIO, etc. A DAO with these explicit roles could be argued to simply be a company with its stock listed on the blockchain. </p>
    <p>DAOs are typically constructed to have their voters vote directly on proposals that come before the DAO. This means that the members of the DAO have a direct influence in the success or failure of the overall venture. Unfortunately there are some gotchas to this egalitarian setup that are not immediately obvious. </p>  
    <p>The first question one needs to ask is why very, very few large for profit organizations are structured as direct democracies? The answer for normal companies lies in the value of having a singular mind act as the “architect” of the overall organization. This is the reason why so many tech companies that are successful are Founder lead. The people who had the vision to bring the entity into the world are typically the people who have the ability and motivation to take it from one scale to the next and ultimately drive it to success. Boards, filled with “representatives” typically do not display a similar drive and love for the business as the Founder.</p>
    <p>It is possible for a company to be successfully led by a successor to the Founder, but this is typically much rarer. “Companies are started by people wanting to make money and then handed over to people trying to save money” the saying goes. Sadly this bears out in real life. </p>
    <p>Arguably the greatest example of the value of a Founder is Steve Jobs at Apple. In 1997, when Steve Job returned from exile, one of his first orders of business was to get rid of the board and effectively silence the token holders. This may sound authoritarian, but it saved the company. Getting rid of the board allowed Jobs to refocus Apple on the products he saw as truly game-changing. This discernment of what was truly game-changing was Jobs’ unique gift, which the board and token holders alone could not deliver. If you’re reading this on an iPhone, you hold the proof in your hands.</p>
    <p>Leaving the decision-making up to “everyone”--in other words, democracy--is better than chaos, but it lacks the kind of effective, visionary decision-making that led Apple to focus on and create the iPhone. Further, it relies on wide participation from the relevant population, even if they aren’t experts on the relevant issues.</p>
    <p>Foundry aims to address this problem by allowing specialization in management to emerge. This is accomplished via liquid democracy. Liquid democracy is a fusion of representative democracy with direct democracy. It allows individual holders to either vote on proposals directly or delegate their vote to another token holder. And if a user is unhappy with the behavior of who they’ve delegated to, they can de-delegate, immediately removing their voting weight from the bad decision.</p>
    <p>This somewhat inoculates against the madness of crowds by giving an opportunity for those who are good at evaluating proposals, to gain more direct influence than they might be able to buy in token holdings. And yet the abuse of this power is quite limited, because unhappy delegators will simply leave to directly vote or choose better delegates.</p>
    <p>This changes the dynamic of token holder voting. If Alice has a reputation for wise voting, she’ll gain more voting power as other token-holders delegate to her, even if Alice herself is a relatively small holder. This should lead to experts of sorts forming at two tiers: those who are good at analysing proposals and those who are good at spotting those who are good at proposal analysis. </p>
    <p>So say Alice is supreme at separating the wheat from the chaff in proposals, but she only has a small amount of $FRY. Bob is really good at spotting talent and making friends. Bob thinks Alice should run the show. Bob has moderate tokens but not enough to turn the boat. Bob however has lots of friends and a reputation for being a mensch. So Charlie, Dale and Ellen, who are mega big time whales who got into $FRY thanks to Bob, decide they’ll rather just have Bob make the decisions. So they delegate to him. Bob in turn delegates to Alice. The result is that Alice has an enormous ability to steer the ship, which is what we want! </p>
    <p>Now in our hypothetical, let’s assume that Alice eventually evaluates some proposals that have Foundry invest in plastics, something some token holders who have indirectly delegated to her might not approve of. If Ellen one day decides to check in on the Foundry governance, she’ll be able to tell what her tokens are supporting. If Ellen doesn’t think there are mad gainz to be made in plastics, she can either dedelagate and vote against the plastics play directly or delegate to Gary, another mensch who happens to also oppose the relevant proposal. </p>
    <p>Most of the time however, most of the token holders can simply assign tokens to someone they trust and the upwards delegation structure will take care of the rest. </p>
    <p>Now, will this work? We’re not exactly sure. We are unaware of an organization with this structure having been attempted before. Cleary it is not strongly founder lead, nor is it a board capture corporation. Our hope is that it offsets the madness of crowds with enough of the wisdom of crowds and responsible individuals to make clear headed decisions. We believe however something beautiful will emerge.</p>
