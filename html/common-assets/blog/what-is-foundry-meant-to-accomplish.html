    <p>As with a conventional organization, this can be answered in two ways: a mission statement and a profit motive.</p>
    <p>Foundry's mission is to build technology and tools that increase worldwide financial freedom, especially when those tools are difficult/risky for traditional institutions to build. Our <a href="/products">existing two products</a> illustrate this. DAIHard facilitates unstoppable entry and exit into crypto, even in jurisdictions where this is illegal. SmokeSignal facilitates unstoppable and uncensorable chat, and is similarly designed to work even in jurisdictions hostile to free speech.</p>
    <p>Foundry's profit motive is based on a simple premise: that there are opportunities to build products like those above, that will result in profit, but which are too difficult or risky for a conventional corporation to build. Because a DAO lacks certain attack surfaces compared to conventional corporations, Foundry should be able to fill and explore these niches with far lower costs and greater flexibility, rapidly realizing profit.</p>
    <p>In short, Foundry is expected to profit by building profitable enterprises that are too hot for conventional institutions to build safely.</p>
