        Fundamentals investor Joel Greenblatt, author of “The little book that beats the market” and creator of MagicFormulaInvesting.com, tells the story of how he teaches children about the wisdom of the crowd vs irrational exuberance. He takes a jar of jelly beans that he carries with him to every school, and passes it around the class, asking children to count the number of jelly beans in the jar. This is a favorite of people trying to demonstrate the wisdom of the crowds, but Greenblatt adds a little twist. He does two counts. The first is private, each child in the class writes down the number of Jelly Beans they think is in the jar. The second is public, the Jelly Beans are passed down the rows and each child says their estimate out load and Greenblatt tallies them. The first count, the private one, is typically accurate within 1% of the jelly bean amount. The second count, the public one, is off by 50%.

    <p>
        This story illustrates the following: the wisdom of the crowd does not hold up under echo chamber conditions. Exchange markets are, for better or worse, echo chambers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Echo chambers form as a side effect of the social wisdom heuristic with which most people make decisions. Most of us simply cannot afford to test every possible commonly held belief for ourselves. We cannot afford to walk over the highway to see if being hit by traffic does indeed kill, we need to take the word of others for this. In other words, we gain most of our knowledge through social means.. When such high levels of certainty for most practical matters, it actually makes a lot of sense to move with the herd… most of the time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem with the social wisdom heuristic is that, because it is so reliable, questioning something that everyone else believes is true, can be very intimidating. Occasionally we need to break away from the herd and think for ourselves. This becomes very, very difficult if most of the people around us react with surprise about our questions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the context of a financial market the social wisdom heuristic actually becomes inverted into what might be termed the social madness heuristic. The same mechanism that helps us stay alive physically, can ruin us financially. In a market euphoria, the major “signal” is price. We don’t like to admit it, but from price, most of us make our decisions. So when easy credit kicks off a mild rally, people see green candles and then more people pile in, creating more green candles. Before we know it we’re telling each other that a “new paradigm” has arrived and indefinite growth is possible. These promises have never once panned out. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we run out of buyers we typically go from group euphoria to group despondency. The process of seeing green is replaced by seeing red and panic selling in successive waves. At a certain point we reach maximal despondency and we start telling each other how the world has basically ended.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a fund manager the problem creates an equally big paradox for you. You might be really good at discerning between real value, irrational exuberance, and despondency. You might have your emotions perfectly under control. You might have a real winning alpha strategy to make tonnes of money over the next few years. The problem is that everyone who is willing to give you assets to manage, is unfortunately human. They will give you money after your strategy has made money, which is typically at the end of the strategy, and they will take back their funds during draw downs or at least not give you any more funds. So the good fund managers typically get offered tonnes of money when he has no strategy for it, and slowly loses money before he has a solid plan again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Can this be turned on its head? We believe so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Foundry doesn’t aim to fight this phenomenon, it aims to capture its energy and turn it into long term value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly the Foundry sale (sale.foundrydao.com) is a very long running token sale. It will last a total of just under 19 months. If during this period another crypto rally, akin to 2017, kicks off, then Foundry stands to capture a disproportionate amount of that value for the longer term. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason for this is that the Foundry sale is a one way valve. Money goes in, but does not exit again unless it’s for a stakeholder proposal. When the price of FRY rallies, rational speculators will attempt to arbitrage freshly minted FRY from the sale against the secondary market. After the initial sale is completed a continuous sale of 5% of the FRY supply will be sold annually. This is to ensure that any future rally can also be capitalized on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It is worth noting that the dilution of FRY is offset by an increase in assets under management of approximately the same value as the FRY. So for existing holders there is a % of ownership dilution but not a value dilution. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The dynamic of capturing value at the market price of FRY turns the fund manager’s paradox on it’s head. During times of irrational exuberance, Foundry can capture a form of money that isn’t subject to the speculative hype cycle. During a subsequent bear market, Foundry’s Treasury retains the raised DAI.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sale model has the additional effect of rewarding patience. Most people don’t apply the patience to, and don’t have the inclination to, properly understand markets and pick winning products. The sale model lets patience, strategic participants pick up a larger share of governance tokens. This increases the likelihood of success of Foundry and the profit potential for all token holders. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In essence the model captures energy during bull markets to  fund the development of quality products during bear markets. This is the inverse of what happened during the ICO boom. The funds raised were denominated in Ether, for which the major use at the time was to participate in ICOs. Very, very few projects sold as they raised and most opted to hold the Eth at extreme draw downs. As the ICO crazy died down, so did the demand for Eth and as the projects began to buidl they had to sell Eth, further depressing the price. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Foundry on the other hand will be freed from the worries of when to sell what. It can now use the same expertise that formed its treasury to identify and fund interesting, profitable projects.
